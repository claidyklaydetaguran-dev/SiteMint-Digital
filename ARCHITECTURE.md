# SiteMint Digital CRM — Architecture Guide

> Read this file before every development session.
> Last updated: 2026-06-27 (Phase 24A+24B)

---

## Project Overview

SiteMint Digital CRM is an internal admin tool for `sitemintdigital.com`. It manages the full sales lifecycle: capturing leads from the Discovery Portal, tracking them through a pipeline, communicating via email/SMS, scoring them with DISC behavioral intelligence, generating proposals and SOWs, and running personalized email campaigns.

**There is no public-facing product.** All routes under `/admin` require a session token obtained from `POST /api/admin/login`.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24 |
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 (strict) |
| Frontend | React + Vite + wouter + shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Express 5 |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM |
| Validation | Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod` |
| Email | Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY`) |
| Phone/SMS | Twilio (`TWILIO_*` env vars) |
| Auth | Session token in memory; `POST /api/admin/login` → Bearer token stored in `localStorage` as `adminToken` |
| Migration | `drizzle-kit push` only — **no migration files** |
| Build | esbuild (CJS bundle via `build.mjs`) |

## Locked Engines — Do Not Modify Without Explicit Request

These files are compute engines with complex, tested logic. Touching them risks breaking lead scoring, DISC analysis, and communication intelligence across the entire CRM.

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lib/discEngine.ts` | `computeSimplifiedDisc`, `getCommunicationStyle`, `DISC_META` — DISC behavioral typing |
| `lib/leadScore.ts` | `computeLeadHealthScore` — multi-factor lead health scoring |
| `lib/communicationIntelligence.ts` | `buildCommunicationIntelligence` — activity-based CI signals |
| `lib/workflowEngine.ts` | Trigger/action workflow execution engine |
| `routes/phone.ts` | All Twilio SMS, voice, and webhook handlers |

---

## Campaign Feature Inventory

### Complete
| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Campaign builder | Name, subject, body editor |
| Draft persistence | `crm_campaigns` table; `status: draft\|ready\|archived` |
| Recipient persistence | `crm_campaign_recipients` with DISC-personalized subject + body |
| Manual send execution | `POST /crm/campaigns/:id/send` — sends to all `selected`/`failed` recipients |
| Test send | Both persisted (`/:id/test-send`) and unsaved-draft (`/test-send`) variants |
| Per-recipient status tracking | `status: selected\|test_previewed\|sent\|skipped\|failed` + `lastError` |
| Resend failed | `POST /crm/campaigns/:id/recipients/:recipientId/resend` |
| Analytics view | `GET /crm/campaigns/:id/analytics` — sent, skipped, failed counts |
| Event tracking table | `crm_campaign_events` — `sent\|failed\|skipped\|opened\|clicked\|bounced\|replied_estimated` |
| Resend webhook endpoint | `POST /crm/webhooks/resend` — receives open/click/bounce events from Resend |
| Unique open/click tracking | Deduplication via Set on `campaignRecipientId` in analytics query |
| Performance insights | `openRate`, `clickRate`, `bounceRate` computed in analytics route |
| Campaign list polish | Recipient counts, status badges, history view |

### Not Yet Built
| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Campaign scheduling | Send at a future date/time |
| Drip sequences | Multi-step automated email flows |
| A/B testing | Subject/body variant testing |
| Segment automation | Auto-enroll leads by filter/tag |
| Live send progress | Real-time browser progress bar during batch send |
| Deduplicated webhook DB index | Dedup currently in-memory (Set); no unique DB constraint on `(campaign_recipient_id, event_type)` |

## Suggested Future Phases

1. **Phase 24C — Behavioral Timeline UI** — Behavior Timeline card in SalesWorkspace; Lead DNA score panel; Intent Stage badge; event feed with score impact labels
2. **Phase 24D — Intent Stage System** — replace raw stage field with 10-bucket intent stage; dashboard panel showing distribution
3. **Phase 24E — Campaign Intelligence** — email objectives, desired behaviors, conditional routing (opened → path A, ignored → path B)
4. **Phase 24F — Sales Intelligence Recommendations** — "Call John today — Intent rose 38% this week" panel in CrmDashboard
5. **SMS Consent Management UI** — admin view for opt-in/opt-out status, consent history
6. **Campaign Scheduling** — schedule a campaign to send at a specific date/time
7. **Drip Sequence Builder** — multi-step email flows triggered by lead actions
8. **AI Copilot Drafting** — AI-assisted subject/body suggestions in the campaign builder
9. **Client Portal** — lead-facing status page for proposals and SOWs
10. **Executive Forecasting Dashboard** — revenue forecast, pipeline velocity, win-rate trends

## Which Modules Future Prompts May Touch

- **Campaigns** (`CrmCampaigns.tsx`, `crm.ts` campaign section, `campaignPersonalization.ts`, `crmCampaigns.ts` schema) — STABLE; future work: scheduling, drip sequences, A/B testing
- **Reporting** (`CrmReporting.tsx`) — additional metrics, charts
- **Dashboard** (`CrmDashboard.tsx`, `CrmExecutiveDashboard.tsx`) — new KPI tiles
- **Deals / Pipeline** (`CrmDeals.tsx`, `CrmPipeline.tsx`) — new stages or fields
- **Inbox** (`CrmInbox.tsx`) — read-side; do not touch send paths in `phone.ts`
- **Email Templates** (`CrmEmailTemplates.tsx`) — new template fields

## Which Modules Future Prompts Must NOT Touch (Unless Explicitly Requested)

- `routes/phone.ts` — entire file (Twilio webhooks)
- `lib/discEngine.ts` — DISC engine
- `lib/leadScore.ts` — Lead health engine
- `lib/communicationIntelligence.ts` — CI engine
- `lib/workflowEngine.ts` — Workflow engine


---

## Known Constraints

- **Email test mode**: if `CRM_EMAIL_TEST_MODE` env var is not set to `"false"`, all Resend sends are simulated (`testMode: true` in response).
- **Campaign send is synchronous**: `POST /campaigns/:id/send` sends all recipients in a single async loop; there is no real-time progress stream. Large lists may take several seconds.
- **Auth token is in-memory**: the session token changes on every API server restart. Frontend must re-login after a server restart.
- **Default admin password**: `sitemint2024` (overridable via `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var).
- **Route ordering in `crm.ts`**: static routes (e.g. `/campaigns/test-send`) must appear BEFORE parameterized routes (e.g. `/campaigns/:id`) to avoid Express matching conflicts.
